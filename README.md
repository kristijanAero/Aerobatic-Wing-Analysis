===== Acrobatic Wing Analysis Overview ====

Goal of the analysis is to compare different types of structural variations of the wing subjected to extreme loads.
As the wing has to pass static load tests of 20G, main task will be minimizing the mass while still satisfying load conditions.

Process is explained through series of small reports each pertaining to one part of the model or design.

AC_ST - Acrobatic wing stiffeners variant - to be uploaded

Accompanying the reports are files from either SolidWorks or Femap, as well as the code used in MATLAB calculations.
