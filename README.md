===== Acrobatic Wing Design Overview ====

Preliminary design process is underway. 

At the moment, initial configuration has been made. Failure criteria are satisfied but the buckling of the skin close to the root is proving to be an issue. Once buckling is eliminated through certain layup modifications and/or rib quantity increase in the section of the wing between the root and aileron inner rib, first version of the project will be uploaded.
